# "Find Your Hat" Project with Javascript Class concept
## Project Goals

 An interactive terminal game is made in this project. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

 A field consists of a grid containing “holes” (O) and one “hat” (^). We use a neutral background character (░) to indicate the rest of the field itself. The player will begin in the field by player’s path which is represented by *.

## Technologies used:
Javascript (ES6) with help of node.js and VS code. Also imported module 'prompt-sync' in this project. To use this module, you need to have node install on your PC prior to use of 'prompt-sync'.

## How to use this project

Download the Find_Your_Hat_JavascriptClass.git from my GitHub account. Once downloaded open VS code and run the project. Go on terminal and you should be in current directory where your main.js file is. Before running main.js, you need to install prompt-sync module. The command to install this module is "npm i prompt-sync". Once downloaded you can run this on terminal using commang "node main.js"
